# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game I created in Python. The player chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The program then decides who wins based on the classic rules of the game. This project helped me practice working with user input, random choices, and conditional statements in Python.
